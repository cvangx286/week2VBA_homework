# Summary: 
Overall, refactoring VBA scripts can bring on efficiency by taking fewer steps and using less memory. However, refactoring scripts that have been performing well may take time to review and decipher. Some may  result in more time in defining and reviewing existing VBA scripts that may be a loss of a resource. The orginal VBA scripts were performing in under 5 seconds but may take days/hours to refactor. The decision in refactoring scripts should be reviewed with the amount of effort to determine if it wil be beneficial.
